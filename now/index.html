		<p>
			Here's everything that's changed and changing in my life lately.
			The idea is that if we haven't spoken in 6 months, this is the kind
			of stuff I wanna tell you about.

		<h1>Old web pet games, my beloved</h1>
		<p>
			I used to play PokéFarm back in the day, and I recently got the itch to 
			try it out again. It might have already been like it, and I was just too 
			young to care, but it's got a lot of microtransactions and "pay to not 
			spend weeks grinding", that I am just not a fan of.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus began my quest to find a different pet sim that scratched that itch.
			Turns out PokéFarm was inspired by a different site, Global PokéDex Plus,
			and I like that site a lot more. I've only been on it for a few hours as 
			of writing, but I like it enough to add little links to my Pokémon 
			all over my website. You can feed them if you want, but don't feel 
			pressured to. Even if this one is like, really cute.

		<h1>...mimuki employment arc?</h1>
		<p>
			As part of my personal hell of "I'm too disabled to work, but not 
			disabled enough for the government to let me not work", if I want to
			keep having an income, I need to be working on self improvement to
			make me more employable. Part of that was applying to volunteer
			work which for the most part, were positions no one would hire a 
			disabled man for. But I got a job! I now have government mandated
			knitting, and I need to keep knitting or risk losing my income.
		</p>
		<p>
			As dystopian and miserable as that is, I like to knit, and I was 
			gonna do it anyway, so at least there's that. And I'm supporting an
			organization that (among other things) supports rural & Indigenous 
			communities, so at least its morally good work, unlike most.

		<h1>Insert funny Wii pun here</h1>
		<p>
			I have owned a wii for a long while now, but only recently found the
			money to buy the adapter I needed to use it with my monitor! Really
			excited to play some games I feel nostalgic about.
		</p>

		<h1>Wheelchair upgrades, baby!</h1>
		<p>
			I recently set up a ko-fi, and got a surprising amount of support
			there. With that I've replaced my casters for some glittery gold
			ones, and got some pre-loved brakes working. This chair is always in 
			a state of falling apart, but this extra money has meant that I can 
			buy extras of the most fragile pieces (mainly	screws that like to 
			rust or get stripped), which is such a reassuring experience.

	<section>
		<h1>Website shenanigans</h1>
		<p>
			Lipamanka got my brain into website hyperfocus mode, so I've gotten
			this website online and started yelling into the void on it. Ideally
			with only a few questionable typos, but I'm getting there.
		</p>

		<h1>Self improvement, but like, the cool kind</h1>
		<p>
			I've been more strict on my relationship with social media, and it's
			been an interesting challenge. I have my phone set up so that all
			my go-to chat apps redirect me to my notes, and I instead microblog
			to the void about what's on my mind. It's interesting, and actually
			pretty fun. I'm still social media-ing on my PC as normal, but the
			idea is to make it more of a "destination" than it normally is. If
			you've been wondering why I've been less "around", that's
			potentially why.
		</p>
		<p>
			My self control with maintaining this has been...less than great,
			but it's an insightful process regardless.
