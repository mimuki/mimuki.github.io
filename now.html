            Here's everything that's changed and changing in my life lately.
            The idea is that if we haven't spoken in 6 months, this is the kind
            of stuff I wanna tell you about.

          <h1>Insert funny Wii pun here</h1>
          <p>
            I have owned a wii for a long while now, but only recently found the
            money to buy the adapter I needed to use it with my monitor! Really
            excited to play some games I feel nostalgic about.

          <h1>Wheelchair upgrades, baby!</h1>
          <p>
            I recently set up a ko-fi, and got a surprising amount of support
            there. With that I've replaced my casters for some glittery gold
            ones, and I'm in the process of picking out my new brakes. This 
            chair is always in a state of falling apart, but this extra money
            has meant that I can buy extras of the most fragile pieces (mainly
            screws that like to rust or get stripped), which is such a
            reassuring experience.

          <h1>Website shenanigans</h1>
          <p>
            Lipamanka got my brain into website hyperfocus mode, so I've gotten
            this website online and started yelling into the void on it. Ideally
            with only a few questionable typos, but I'm getting there.

          <h1>Self improvement, but like, the cool kind</h1>
          <p>
            I've been more strict on my relationship with social media, and it's
            been an interesting challenge. I have my phone set up so that all
            my go-to chat apps redirect me to my notes, and I instead microblog
            to the void about what's on my mind. It's interesting, and actually
            pretty fun. I'm still social media-ing on my PC as normal, but the
            idea is to make it more of a "destination" than it normally is. If
            you've been wondering why I've been less "around", that's
            potentially why.
          </p>
          <p>
            My self control with maintaining this has been...less than great,
            but it's an insightful process regardless.

          <h1>Still knitting, as always</h1>
          <p>
            I recently finished a knit bag which I am now using for my current 
            project- a big blanket I'm making from cheap kmart yarn. The pattern
            is super simple and makes for excellent TV knitting without getting
            too monotonous.
