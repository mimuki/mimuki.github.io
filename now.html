            Here's everything that's changed and changing in my life lately.
            The idea is that if we haven't spoken in 6 months, this is the kind
            of stuff I wanna tell you about.

          <h1>Wheelchair upgrades, baby!</h1>
          <p>
            I recently set up a ko-fi, and got a surprising amount of support
            there. With that I've replaced my casters for some glittery gold
            ones, and I'm in the process of picking out my new brakes. This 
            chair is always in a state of falling apart, but this extra money
            has meant that I can buy extras of the most fragile pieces (mainly
            screws that like to rust or get stripped), which is such a
            reassuring experience.

          <h1>Website shenanigans</h1>
          <p>
            Lipamanka got my brain into website hyperfocus mode, so I've gotten
            this website online and started yelling into the void on it. Ideally
            with only a few questionable typos, but I'm getting there.

          <h1>Self improvement, but like, the cool kind</h1>
          <p>
            I've been more strict on my relationship with social media, and it's
            been an interesting challenge. I have my phone set up so that all
            my go-to chat apps redirect me to my notes, and I instead microblog
            to the void about what's on my mind. It's interesting, and actually
            pretty fun. I'm still social media-ing on my PC as normal, but the
            idea is to make it more of a "destination" than it normally is. If
            you've been wondering why I've been less "around", that's
            potentially why.

          <h1>Still knitting, as always</h1>
          <p>
              I got into knitting last year, and I've made some neat stuff like
              some hoods and a scarf. I wrote about said scarf in toki pona taso
              but I forgot to save that (or ever use that website again, oops),
              so it's lost to the internet now.
          </p>

            I recently finished a seasonally inappropriate beanie, which came 
            out really nicely, if too big for any human head. I'm currently 
            working on a bag, one of those ones that have lots of holes and you
            would put oranges in or something. It's just to use up scrap yarn, 
            until I find a project I like enough to start. I'm tempted to make
            a temperature blanket for 2023, but with how much yarn that takes
            it's looking like a 2024 project.

          <h1>Dwarf Fortress</h1>
          <p>
            Steam DF came out at last, but it's impossible to play with keynav
            or keynavish. After a lot of research I've just settled on learning
            classic DF, but that's been both very confusing and very rewarding
            and fun. It's one of those things I put on the side out of
            frustration, but I have been having a go every so often. I just find
            the barrier to starting is so big, but once I get in I have a blast.

            Video games do be like that sometimes.
