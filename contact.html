					Hi! Nice to see a familiar face on our website. If you aren't already,
					you should follow us on the Fediverse at
					<a href="https://myfriendsare.gay/rats">@rats@myfriendsare.gay</a>.
					Just send us a message with your follow request if you use a different
					username there, so we know who you are. As of writing (01/2023) it's
					still actively used and is your best way to get in touch. We're also
					<a href="https://toki.social/mimuki">@mimuki@toki.social</a>, but that
					page is predominantly in toki pona. If both of those websites catch
					fire, send us mail at (this domain minus the .github.io)@proton.me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Beyond anything we tell you about in private, we don't really have
					much of an online presence social media wise. We use Discord, but that
					account is one we don't hand out often; one-on-one coversations are
					stressful, and we prefer to linger in communal spaces. We also get
					antsy from being in too many discord servers, lmao.
				</p>
				<p>
					We formerly used Matrix, but don't have the tech literacy to self-host
					safely, and don't like the current clients available. If there's some
					other privacy centric messenger you would like us to use, or think we
					would want to know about, I'd love to know (but might never use it).

				<h1>For future friends</h1>
				<p>
					Our toki pona account on the fediverse is public, if you speak it:
					<a href="https://toki.social/mimuki">@mimuki@toki.social</a>. If not,
					we're in the ma pona pi toki pona discord server, and it's a great
					place to get to know us in a space we're comfortable in. If you're
					the kind of people we especially get along with (fellow disabled
					plural whiten't neurodivergent queers), shoot us a follow request on
					<a href="https://myfriendsare.gay/rats">@rats@myfriendsare.gay</a>. We
					might sit on that follow request for a while so we can get to know
					your vibes, though. If you aren't, and you send us a follow request
					anyway, it's appreciated that you DM us as well.
