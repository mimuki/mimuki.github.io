			I'm not disabled enough for the Disability Support Pension, so in order to 
			live I get the Jobseeker payment, which needs you to be actively seeking
			employment (or becoming more employable). As part of my mutual obligations
			I had to apply to volunteer jobs, and take the first one that accepted me,
			which lead me to volunteer knitting. I will put my income at risk by 
			quitting, thus the term Government Mandated Knitting is born.

		<p>
			Here I'll document the stuff I make, until writing about them stops being
			good to me.

		<h1>Beanie #1</h1>
		<p>
			Started: Feb 2023
		<br>
			Pattern: (todo link later) (free)
		</p>
		<p>
			This pattern was a bit of a doozy to start with. The ribbing is done on 
			3mm needles, which are really painful for me. Once you get past that, 
			every other round is knit 3 together and leave them on the left needle, 
			yarn over, knit the same 3 together, over and over again, with some bonus 
			purls and stitch marker shenanigans.
		</p>
		<p>
			Truly one of the decisions of all time. Really slow to work on, but I've
			picked up speed as I get used to it. About 8 hours in I made a mistake,
			causing the pretty spiral to become a weird straight line on one side,
			thanks to an extra stitch that snuck in at one point. That beanie is 
			currently in Yarn Jail until I get the energy to frog back and redo it, 
			because I did two more hours before deciding it wouldn't go away with 
			wishful thinking.
