					<h1>Hobbies</h1>
					<p>
						I have, like, so many things that I'll swing between. Sometimes I'll 
						go months without thinking about one of them, and then hyperfixate 
						on them for a while, and the cycle repeats. Here are some of those 
						things that came to mind. I also have things that I've done and 
						enjoyed, but haven't quite made it to 'hobby' status. I don't know 
						if or when I'll write about them, but I definitely have them.

					<h1 id="knitting">Knitting</h1>
						<p>
							I'm a huge fan of knitting, and have made a variety of things I'm
							proud of. Maybe someday I'll write about them and have a really 
							convinient link to them here. There's something special about	a 
							task thats both complex but simple once you wrap your head around 
							it. Taking something that's not useful on its own (balls of yarn 
							have limited usefulness as balls of yarn), and turning it into
							the thing you wanted or needed. Super cool.
						</p>

						<h1 id="vr">VR gaming</h1>
							<p>
								VR is also some (prohibitively expensive) tech I care about a 
								lot. I used to make custom avatars for VRChat and Neos, and have 
								countless hours in those games spent with strangers I'll never
								meet again. I also really enjoy singleplayer experiences like 
								Vermillion, a VR painting program for all your "painting on a 
								canvas" needs. As I play more games I might list them here. I
								currently play on a Meta Quest 2, and formerly used a Rift S.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h1 id="keebs">Mechanical keyboards</h1>
							<p>
								Yet another surprisingly expensive hobby. I had a passive 
								interest in them, and owned a Logitech fullsize keyboard. But as 
								my physical health deteriorated, this became increasingly tough 
								on my joints and nerve pain. TL;DR: I bought a keebio iris rev. 
								4, taught myself colemak mod dh, and I can still use my 
								computer. So... yay.
							</p>
							<p>
								Also, I have my keyboard strapped to my legs, so that's cool.
