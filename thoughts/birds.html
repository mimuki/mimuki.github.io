					<h1>Birds are cool, actually</h1>
					<p>
							I've been spending more time in the lounge room lately, which has
							a big, glass sliding door. If I open its blinds, I get a pretty
							good view of my backyard. As a result, I've also started noticing
							the wildlife, too.
					</p>
					<p>
							Having some sort of external <em>something</em> to be aware of
							has helped a lot with feeling more grounded and aware of the
							passage of time. I'd like to get some feed for the birds, but I'd
							need to first figure out what's safe for them. I'd also like to
							focus on fixing up the yard in general, too.

					<h1>The magpies</h1>
					<p>
						There seems to be two regular visitors- one that's a bit smaller,
						and likes to try and fight his reflection. The other one likes to
						lurk around too, but I haven't been able to figure out any of its
						patterns yet.
					</p>

					<h1>The pigeons</h1>
					<p>
							There's also a pair of pigeons I've noticed once or twice. I'm
							not even completely sure they are pigeons at all, but they look
							pigeon-y enough that that's what I'm calling them. They like to
							poke around in the dead grass. I wonder if they're finding
							anything in there?
